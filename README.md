Mac OSX (10.7 targeted) An application to provide a quick reference interface for code methods or links. Uses Core data with 3 entities each entity has its own array controller and table object. The table structure is Reference name, Reference information, Reference Type. All user input, records can be saved, deleted, and added. Will add in options to populate the database entities with references I find useful or you can just put in your own. More to come probably an html status quick reference area for status.
